    <h3>Wonderful baked chicken with minimal mess to make for easy clean-up. My daughter says it's her favorite teriyaki chicken ever! Can be easily adapted to your tastes and can also be done on the stove if you prefer. Serve over rice.</h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>0,5 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>0,25 cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>0,25 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until dissolved; set aside. Combine soy sauce, sugar, mirin, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes together in a saucepan over medium heat until the mixture starts to simmer. Slowly whisk in cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken dry with paper towels; arrange in a baking dish. Pour sauce over chicken breasts, coating all sides.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
